## Notes on the Product Backlog

This backlog outlines the core functionality required for each user role — Client, Freelancer, and Admin — along with technical and platform-wide priorities. Items are tagged by importance to guide incremental development and sprint planning.

Each user story is framed from the user’s perspective to ensure feature relevance and usability. As development progresses, stories can be broken down further into tasks and acceptance criteria.

The backlog is designed to evolve — new stories may be added as features expand, user feedback is received, or technical needs change. Use it as a living document during team planning and retrospectives.
