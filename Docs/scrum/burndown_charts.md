# Sprint Burndown Charts

This section includes the sprint burndown charts for each team member over the 5 sprint weeks.

## Summary

We observed the following overall trend:
- **Weeks 1â€“2:** High velocity and rapid progress.
- **Week 3:** Progress slowed significantly due to blockers and overlapping deadlines.
- **Week 4:** Major progress resumed with cleared responsibilities and improved focus.
- **Week 5:** Approaching deadline accelerated task completions.
